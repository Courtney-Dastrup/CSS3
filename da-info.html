                <h2>To This Day</h2>
                <p>When I was a kid, I used to think that porkchops and karate chops were the same thing. I thought they were both porkchops. And because my Grandmother thought it was cute and because they were my favorite, she let me keep doing it. Not really a big deal. Then one day, before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees, I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body. I didn't want to tell my grandmother about it because I was scared I'd get in trouble for playing somewhere I shouldn't have been. A few days later, my gym teacher noticed the bruise and I was sent to the principal's office.</p>

                <h2>B</h2>
                <p>If I should have a daughter, she's going to call me point B. Because that way she knows that no matter what happens, she will always find her way to me. And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands. So she has to learn the entire universe before she can say, "Oh I know that like the back of my hand." And she's going to learn that this life will hit you, hard, in the face. Wait for you to get back up just so it can kick you in the stomach, but getting the wind knocked out of you is the only way to remind your lungs how much they like the taste of air. There is hurt, here, that cannot be fixed by band-aids or poetry.</p>

                <h2>Explaining Depression to My Mother: A Conversation</h2>
                <p>Mom, my depression is a shapeshifter. One day it's as small as a firefly in the palm of a bear, the next it's the bear. On those days I play dead until the bear leaves me alone. I call the bad days the dark days. Mom says try lighting candles. But when I see a candle I see the flesh of a church, the flicker of a flame, sparks of a memory younger than noon. I am standing beside her open casket.</p>

                <h2>Paper People</h2>
                <p>I like people. I'd like some paper people. They'd be purple paper people. Maybe pop-up purple paper people. Proper pop-up purple paper people. How do you prop up proper pop-up purple paper people I hear you cry. Well I. I would probably prop up proper pop-up purple paper people with a proper pop-up purple people paper clip, but I'd pre-prepare apropriate adhesives as alternatives a cheeky pack of blu-tack just incase the paper sliped, 'cause I could build a pop-up metropolis. But I wouldn't want to deal with all those paper people politics. Paper politicians with their paper thin policies.</p>

                <h2>Instructions for a Bad Day</h2>
                <p>There will be bad days. Be calm. Loosen your grip opening each palm slowly now. Let go. Be confident. Know that now is only a moment and that if today is as bad as it gets, understand that by tomorrow, today will have ended. Be gracious. Accept each extended hand offering to pull you back from the somewhere you cannot escape.Be diligent. Scrape the gray sky clean. Realize that every dark cloud is a smokescreen meant to blind us from the truth, and the truth is whether we see them or not the sun and moon are still there and always there is light.</p>
